	/**
	 * HashMap storing mapping between property's name and its value.
	 * 
	 * Storing field's properties in a collection rather than class's attributes has many merits.
	 * 
	 * It avoids code change whenever there is a new property introduced, either from schema's syntax
	 * update or user's defined annotation. By default, all these new properties should automatically 
	 * be reflected in each datapoint when a schema is applied to a CSV.
	 * 
	 * Imagine doesn't have to do:
	 * 
	 *     datapoint.setNewProp(section.getNewPropAtField(row, col));
	 *     
	 * Which involves creating new attributes, methods in both Field, Schema, and Datapoint classes!
	 * 
	 * IMP Most but not all properties will eventually be applied to each datapoint (schema's field<->datapoint).
	 * Therefore, we should maintain a mapping table of what properties get/not get transferred to datapoint when 
	 * a CSV is parsed against a schema.
	 * 
	 * Rather than pertaining those properties that won't be included in a datapoint as attributes and avoid creating 
	 * above mapping, it's better to keep everything in generic fashion (all properties in a collection) because in the 
	 * future there may be some data model that want to include such schema information in there model too (says, field's 
	 * header information for a tabular oriented data model). 
	 * 
	 * Except for some really fundamental properties to cell's concept like row and column which are not up to schema's 
	 * definition and won't be changed. This slightly increases performance too.
	 *

	 * 
	 * Name of the datapoint which must be unique within the scope of CSV schema.
	 * This must be xml QNAME so it can suffix an IRI to create UUID for each cell.
	 * 
	 * 2. String label
	 * 
	 * Human readable lable of the cell. This is an extra attribute and never is a content of the cell.
	 * 
	 * 3. Class<? extends Cell> type
	 * 
	 * Type of the cell as defined by our CSV schema. This information is reflected in Java type system.
	 * 
	 * 		Cell is a cell containing a value.
	 * 		EmptyCell 	as its name states, it holds no data thus empty. 
	 * 					It'll be validated against [^\\S\r\n]*? regEx for whitespace characters except newline.
	 * 
	 * 4. String regEx
	 * 
	 * 5. datatype
	 * 
	 * 6. comment
