/**
 * 
 * Do you want this to represent each single property of each schema entity OR property type definition for each actual 
 * property object (which may has its own unique value such as weight)?
 * 
 * There is no such thing as "type" in CSV-X schema, since, for example, the property cannot be reused with
 * parameterized attributes without special syntax designed (how to instantiate?). Also type checking or handling 
 * of conflict type of data literal as in javascript, will become an issue.
 * 
 * However, we can introduce "reusable pattern/template/macro" like we did with {var}. Still we need to think of syntax
 * how a pattern may be parameterized for each instance (Yes, everything is instance, so the "template" is a prototype
 * instance in a way).
